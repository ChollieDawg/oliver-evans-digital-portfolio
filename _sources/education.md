# Education
As a lifelong learner, I'm always engaged in a personal project or enrolled in formal education. Below, you'll find a list of my formal education along with a selection of my projects.

In 2017, you'll notice a significant shift in my focus from finance to IT-based learning. My journey into coding began in 2016 when I started building basic websites using HTML and CSS to gain foundational skills. Later that year, my cousin introduced me to Tableau and SQL, sparking my interest in data manipulation—a field I had only touched on during university studies. After experimenting with AdventureWorks, setting up MS SQL Server, and practicing SQL through Khan Academy, I discovered a passion for data and set a goal to become a Business Intelligence Analyst.

In preparation for my studies at BCIT, I immersed myself in learning by reading various books, including <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/training-kit-exam/9780735667259/" target="_blank">Training Kit (Exam 70-461): Querying Microsoft® SQL Server® 2012</a> and <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" target="_blank">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a>. As my Python skills improved, I furthered my education through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mitocw/playlists" target="_blank">MIT OpenCourseWare</a>, particularly their computer science course, and delved into their recommended reading <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262542364/introduction-to-computation-and-programming-using-python/" target="_blank">Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, third edition</a>. This resource was both insightful and occasionally humorous, offering valuable perspectives on how to think about programming.

Today, I feel confident building custom programs in Python using a wide variety of libraries, yet I’m always eager to learn more. That’s what I love about programming—there’s an almost limitless amount to discover!

```{dropdown} Python Automation of Poshmark Account
**Overview**

My wife enjoys buying and selling things online, particularly on a website called Poshmark. Poshmark is a social media selling platform where users are encouraged to follow, share, like, and generally just click a lot of buttons to escalate their Poshmark status. Seeing this, I realized it would be a great opportunity for a project to automate this. Of course, there are repos on Github that do similar things and paid services for $30 USD  a month or so - but I didn't see all the features that I wanted and I can't pass up a good opportunity to learn, so I set about building this and I have actually showcased this project in my [Examples of Work](./poshmark_automation.md) section below.

**What I did**
- Researched the platform to understand what metrics would allow a user to increase their rating on Poshmark.
- Build a program that would log in to the platform and perform various actions such as liking, following, sharing other users' items, and sharing my items. Within these features, I made sure to build in various rules and logic such as only sharing 5 items per follower, or only sharing 10% of my own items per day, and making sure that those items of mine that I was sharing were not previously shared in the last 2 days.
- To help with the logic, I built a database to record all the interactions that other users had with me, as well as the interactions I made with my own 'Closet' (list of items you are selling) - which enabled me to query the database to returns lists of users or items which met criteria I was looking for, which then fed into various functions.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} What I learned
- I learned a lot about element selection on web pages and how to handle or target what I needed. For example, sometimes Javascript would load things up after an action occurred which would mean that the script would have to wait for this to happen first, or it could error.
- Bot detection. Once I finished the basics of my program and it was running reliably, I quickly realized that Poshmark had detected my program was a bot as was asking for a Captcha to be completed at login or random times using the website. This led me to investigate and discover how and why these browsers can be discovered as well as stumbling across a number of libraries that would help resolve this. The one I settled on was Undetected_Chromedriver. I liked this solution as it was based on Selenium which I was already using and as a result, the process to swap to this library only took 5 minutes (once I realized it was an appropriate solution!).
- The more I got into the project, the longer my roadmap for new features has become! Knowing more about the platform and understanding how much my wife would use it has allowed me to bring in other aspects of automation that I was not initially thinking about. For example, I have since built a flask server that allows the user to upload photos, videos, and descriptions of an item. Once a button is clicked, it then will post the item simultaneously to different websites including Poshmark, WordPress, Instagram, and Square. I am still to implement features such as the automatic removal of an item based on selling it on Square.

:::
:::{tab-item} What Would I Do Differently Next Time?
- Planning out the workflow from the start would have been useful. This project scope has been constantly growing since day 1. I am pleased that I have worked through it and have a good solution but the scope creep at times could feel overwhelming, even if it was my own scope creep.

```{dropdown} Create an Air Quality Monitor from a Raspberry Pi 
**Overview**

With the forest fires increasing in frequency in Western North America, I wanted to monitor the air quality within our apartment to understand how bad it could get and provide an easy-to-get location to view this data.

**What I did**
- I purchased a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Model B</a>, <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro?variant=31155658457171" target="_blank">an Enviro+ board</a> and <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/sgp30-air-quality-sensor-breakout?variant=30924091719763" target="_blank">PMS5003 Particulate Matter Sensor</a> as well as a hardware kit to screw together.
- Once I had the Raspberry Pi, I loaded Linux onto it and began working with the sensor to understand the library.
- I then created a script that measured various sizes of particulate matter at intervals throughout the day and plotted them to a chart which I then hosted on a home flask server so that I could just log into it from the local area network.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} What I learned
- I learned about the Linux OS and the quirks of trying to fix broken things.
- Fixing the the hardware together was a little tricky and ultimately I didn't provide the Raspberry Pi a permanent housing which meant it sat exposed on my desk for some time. Eventually, I knocked it and broke a connection on the board! Next time, once the hardware is fully constructed, I will look to provide it with a practical case sooner rather than later.
- I learned more about particulate matter in the air and saw how quickly it can change. I subsequently purchased multiple air filters to reduce the particulate matter.
- This was my first attempt at using a Flask server and I was surprised at how quickly I was able to bring it together.

:::
:::{tab-item} Tools I used
- <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/#" target="_blank">Flask Library</a> for hosting the air quality results, <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Seaborn</a> for visualizing the data. 
- Raspberry Pi, Enviro + board and PMS5003 Particulate Matter Sensor.
- Linux OS.
:::
:::{tab-item} What Would I Do Differently Next Time?
- I would buy some better hardware spacer components to create a more stable build, along with some kind of case that facilitates the board and sensor - likely a 3d printed solution.

- I would likely buy a newer version of the Raspberry Pi as I had some issues with getting a wireless connection to work. I am still not certain if it was the lack of Linux experience - but I had a wired connection so I wasn't too concerned.

```{dropdown} Extract, Transform, and Load Financial Data to a Custom Database for Data Analytics
**Overview**

I wanted a centralized location to track my stock investments - particularly the dividends that I received. The problem was that for various reasons, I had both my and my wife's accounts on multiple platforms. The goal was to bring this data together into 1 database.

**What I did**
- Designed a database to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form" target="_blank">third normal form</a> using a database design tool. Specific features of the database I needed to have were things such as the broker, account owner, stock details such as purchase price, dividends, and industry.
- Created the database in MS SQL Server after a few iterations.
- At this point, I had to make a decision about how I would be extracting the data. Through multiple SSIS packages custom built for each broker OR one script which would consume a Power Query data combination of the data sources. I decided to go with the Power Query option since I was more comfortable with this process and it was more flexible. Once I had consumed the data from multiple sources in the spreadsheet, I created an SSIS package to target this spreadsheet and write the data to the database.
- After building various views for this data, I build a Power BI Visual to track various metrics

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} What I learned
- How delicate some processes of SSIS packages can be. Along the way, I managed to resolve everything I came across and build some fault tolerance.
- The importance of planning prior to building. I iterated many times on my original database design as I realized new features that would be useful. I probably built three or four iterations of the databases before I settled on one.
- Dealing with data discrepancies. Over years worth of data from multiple brokers, there were a couple of errors or inconsistencies from their data which threw my fragile SSIS package into disarray. I added further data checks and transformations to resolve these and future errors.
- Tracking down data integrity issues takes time. It could be frustrating trying to locate the source of the problem - but ultimately quite rewarding once resolved.

:::
:::{tab-item} Tools I used
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WiseOwlTutorials/playlists" target="_blank">Wise Owl Tutorials on Youtube</a> was a fantastic resource for everything SSIS and helped me to understand the basics.
- MS Visual Studio for the SSIS IDE.
- SQL Server Integration Services to build the packages.
- MS SQL Server Management Studio to house my database.
- Excel / Power Query as a middle layer to extract and transform different data sources.
- Power BI to visualize the data.

- The data extraction process was still manually performed by me logging on to various broker websites and downloading reports to specific folders, then going into a master spreadsheet and refreshing, and finally running the SSIS package. A good feature to add would be to automate the extraction of the data from the brokers using Python with tools such as Beautiful Soup or Selenium. That way, more of the data extraction would be automated.

- If I were to do the above step, I might consider building the whole process in Python over SSIS as it is more flexible and customizable.

```{dropdown} Created and Hosted a Commerce Website
**Overview**

My wife has a business where she creates, buys, and sells custom and antique jewelry, and asked me to assist her in creating a website.

**What I did**
- Researched similar websites to get an understanding of the style as well as obtained images for the website.
- Researched web hosting options.
- <a href="https://phoenixleigh.ca/" target="_blank">Created a Wordpress website and hosted it</a>.

:::{tab-item} What I learned
- Although this was far from my first time playing with websites, I learned a lot about the interface of WordPress and how tricky it can be as a framework, particularly with plugins.
- I realized quickly that the website would be a lot of work to sell one-off antique items as each one required significant administration to add to the website, particularly if it was listed on multiple websites.
- Over time, we pivoted the website from an online store to more informational as the upkeep was easier.
- How to install SSL certificates.

:::{tab-item} Tools I used
- WordPress. 
- Photoshop.
:::
:::{tab-item} What Would I Do Differently Next Time?
- I would consider paying the money for a website creating a website like Squarespace since the effort put into this was substantial and requires ongoing maintenance for updating plugins or simple enhancements.

- I would consider building a tool to list and remove items across multiple sites to ease the administrative burden.
