# About Me

I have a deep passion for technology, data, and coding, and thrive in environments where I can continuously learn, teach, and innovate. Among my colleagues, I am known for my dedication, approachable nature, and commitment to refining my skillsâ€”especially in areas like data analysis, automation, and problem-solving. I enjoy exploring data and transforming my knowledge into actionable insights and finding efficient solutions to routine tasks.

Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in Linux, the Metasploit framework, and Selenium automation, which complement my skills and deepen my technical expertise.

I am originally from the South Coast of England near Brighton and in 2008, I relocated to Whistler, BC, to follow my passion for snowboarding. I proudly became a Canadian citizen in 2015. 

Explore my skills and interests below to see how I can add value to data-driven roles.
